## Insp3ct0r [Web-Exploitation]
> Author: zaratec/danny
>
> **Description**
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

As the name of the challenge suggest, we can try to inspect the page by using developer tools.
On Windows Google Chrome, we can press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` or **Right-click** and select **'Inspect Element'**.
On Mac Safari, we can press `Cmd` + `Option` + `I` or **Right-click** and select **Insepct Element**. (You might need to enable Developer menu first)

Something similar to this should show up

![inspect-website.png](/assets/patch/0x01/inspect-website.png)

On the sidebar, we will find all the files related to the website. 

![inspect-files.png](/assets/patch/0x01/inspect-file.png)

We can find portions of the flag in each file (index/myjs.js/mycss.css).


## Web Decode [Web-Exploitation]
> **Description**:
> Do you know how to use the web inspector?
> Start searching [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:64018/) to find the flag

We can navigate around the website using inspect element to try and find the flag. Unfortunately, we won't be able to find a plain text flag anywhere. Under the `About` page, we can find an interesting piece of strings.

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9">
```

Recalling the challenge's name, 'Web **Decode**', this means the challenge probably has something to do with decoding. The given string is in **base64**. You can use any online tools to decode it or alternatively use the built in console to decode it.

```javascript
let tmp = "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9";
console.log(atob(tmp))
```

The flag will be printed out. 


## where are the robots [Web-Exploitation]
> Author: zaratec/Danny
> 
> **Description**:
> Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915

{: .hints}
> What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

The hint suggest a part of website where you are not supposed to go into. A common standard used to indicate which portions of website are allowed to be visited by web crawlers or web robots. However, this robots.txt is advisory and we're feeling a bit mischievious today. So let's try and find the robots.txt of the website. 

Simply type in `robots.txt` after the website link and you will find the following:

![robots.png](/assets/patch/0x01/robots.png)

Then, we go to the link mentioned in the robots.txt, `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/8028f.html` and we should get the flag.


## 13 [Cryptography]
> Author: Alex Fulton/Daniel Tunitis
>
> **Description**:
> Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? `cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

ROT13 (also called Caesar cipher) basically is a simple substituion cipher that replace the letter with the 13th letter after it.

We can then do this by hand, or find any website that can help you do so


## interencdec
> Author: NGIRIMANA Schadrack
>
> **Description**:
> Can you get the real meaning from this file. Download the file [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/1/enc_flag).

We can utilize the picoCTF Webshell to solve this. First we download the file by using `wget`.

```shell
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/1/enc_flag
```

Then, we read the file by using `cat`.

```shell
cat enc_flag
YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyeG9OakJzTURCcGZRPT0nCg==
```

We can see it's a base64 encoded string, we can utilize `base64` to help us decode it.

```shell
base64 -d enc_flag
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ=='
```

Again, it is base64 encoded, but this time we will need to remove the b'' first before decoding it. We can utilise `cut` to help us.

```shell
base64 -d enc_flag | cut -d "'" -f 2
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ=='
```

the `-d "'"` specifies the deliminiter as `'` while the `-f 2` specifies the field chosen. Because it separates at the delimiter, there will be two fields that we can select. First field will be `b` while the second field  will be `d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ==`.

Then, we pipe the output into base64 again to decode it.

```shell
base64 -d enc_flag | cut -d "'" -f 2 | base64 -d 
wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_lh60l00i}
```

Lastly, we will get a string that is rotated, we can use online tools to help us brute force it, or try solving it on our own. Since we already know `wpjvJAM` should turn into `picoCTF`. The command below shows an example solution.

```shell
base64 -d enc_flag | cut -d "'" -f 2 | base64 -d | tr "H-ZA-Gh-za-g" "A-Za-z"
```


## Verify [Forensics]
> Author: Jeffery John
>
> **Description**:
> People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.`ssh -p 49894 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net`Using the password `6dd28e9b`. Accept the fingerprint with `yes`, and `ls` once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!
> - Checksum: 03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8
> - To decrypt the file once you've verified the hash, run `./decrypt.sh files/<file>`.

Upon successful ssh into the server, we can use the `ls` command, we will see a folder will named `files` will a lot of files inside. We need to find the file which checksum match the one given to us. We can utilize `sha256sum` and `grep`

```shell
sha256sum files/* | grep 03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8
```

One file will be returned, then we can use decrypt.sh on the file to get our flag.

```shell
./decrypt.sh files/00011a60
```
