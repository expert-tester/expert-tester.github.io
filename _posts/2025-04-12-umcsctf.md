## Hidden in Plain Graphic [Forensics]
> Agent Ali, who are secretly a spy from Malaysia has been communicate with others spy from all around the world using secret technique . Intelligence agencies have been monitoring his activities, but so far, no clear evidence of his communications has surfaced. Can you find any suspicious traffic in this file?

> **File**: [plain_zight.pcap](/assets/files/umcsctf/plain_zight.pcap)

We are given this pcap file to analyze, by quickly looking through the file and sorting it by length, we will find a packet which contains a `PNG` file within it.

![png-in-packet.png](/assets//img/ctf/umcsctf/png-in-packet.png)

We can then export the `PNG` file by selecting the packet section that contains the `PNG` data and exporting it as `a.png`.

After that, we can run `zsteg -a a.png` and the flag will be returned.

## Hotline Miami [Steganography]
> "You’ve intercepted a mysterious floppy disk labeled 50 BLESSINGS, left behind by a shadowy figure in a rooster mask. The disk contains a cryptic image and a garbled audio file. Rumor has it the message reveals the location of a hidden safehouse tied to the 1989 Miami incident. Decrypt the clues before the Russians trace your signal."

> **File**: [iamthekidyouknowwhatimean.wav](/assets/files/umcsctf/iamthekidyouknowwhatimean.wav), [readme.txt](/assets/files/umcsctf/rooster.jpg), [rooster.jpg](/assets/files/umcsctf/rooster.jpg)

First we take a look at `iamthekidyouknowwhatimean.wav`, it is a song from the game Hotline Miami. Since it is a sound file, we can use Audacity to take a look. we open up Audacity and view sound file as a spectogram. We will see that there is words hidden within it, `Watching 1989`.

![audacity.png](/assets/img/ctf/umcsctf/audacity.png)

Next, looking through the `readme.txt`, we see that there is a particularly interesting line, `Subject_Be_Verb_Year`. Assuming that is the flag format, we already have the `Verb` (Watching) and `Year` (1989). Most likely, the `Be` word will be is/are/was/were, so what about the `Subject`? We look through the last `rooster.jpg` to see if we can find anything. By running `strings rooster.jpg`, we will see there is a `RICHARD` at the very end of the file. 

```
└─$ strings rooster.jpg | tail
Y       9$
Xr?#s

]:/?3
L*EI)Y
:qQJ6]
+;o}?
RICHARD
```

Replacing `richard` with `Subject`, we will then construct our full flag. `Subject_Be_Verb_Year` will become `richard_is_watching_1989` which we will need to enclosed it with `umcs{}`.
